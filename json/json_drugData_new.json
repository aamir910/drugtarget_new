On the contrary, cetuximab does not exert its anti-tumour effects on human tumour xenografts lacking EGFR expression.[A227963, L30448]\n\nCetuximab potentiates the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutics and radiation therapy when used in combination.[L30448] In human tumour xenograft models in mice, cetuximab and irinotecan synergistically inhibited the growth of orthotopic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma xenografts _in vitro_ and _in vivo_. Cetuximab potentiated the _in vitro_ anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of irinotecan and achieved 93% _in vivo_ inhibition of tumour growth when combined with irinotecan, compared to 77% and 79% inhibition when cetuximab and irinotecan were used alone, respectively.[A227978]","moa":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and a type I receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on both normal and malignant cells. It has been investigated as a therapeutic target for anticancer treatment, as it is often upregulated in cancer types, including head and neck, colon, and rectal cancers.[L30448] When activated by its ligand, EGFR undergoes a conformational change and dimerization to form homodimers or heterodimers with another member of the ErbB family of receptors. Dimerization of EGFR activates the intracellular tyrosine kinase region of EGFR and promotes autophosphorylation, initiating a series of downstream signalling cascades, including cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. This EGFR signalling pathway is often dysregulated in cancer cells, leading to aberrant cell growth and enhanced cell survival.[L31418]\n\nCetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the EGFR on both normal and tumour cells to competitively inhibit the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands that are produced by normal and tumour tissue epithelial cells.[A11, L30448] Upon binding to domain III of EGFR - which is the binding site for its growth factor ligands - cetuximab prevents the receptor from adopting an extended conformation and thereby inhibits EGFR activation, as well as phosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases (MAPK, PI3K\/Akt, Jak\/Stat).[A11, A228078] Inhibition of the EGFR signalling pathway ultimately leads to inhibition of cell cycle progression, cell survival pathways, and tumour cell motility and invasion.[A227963] Cetuximab also induces cell apoptosis and decreases matrix metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.[A228078, L30448] _In vitro_, cetuximab was shown to inhibit tumour angiogenesis.[A227978] Binding of cetuximab to EGFR also results in internalization of the antibody-receptor complex, leading to an overall downregulation of EGFR expression.[A227973]\n\nK-ras is a small G-protein downstream of EGFR that plays an important role in promoting the EGFR signalling cascade: in some malignant cells, K-ras can acquire activating mutations in exon 2 [L31418] and thus be continuously active regardless of EGFR regulation.[L30448] Since mutant Ras proteins can isolate the pathway from the effect of EGFR, K-Ras mutations can render EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab ineffective in exerting anti-tumour effects.[L30448, L31418] Cetuximab is thus only limited in its use for K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing cancers.[L30448]","absorption":"After administration of a 400 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> initial dose followed by a 250 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> weekly dose, the steady-state levels of cetuximab was reached by the third weekly infusion with mean peak and trough concentrations across studies ranging from 168 \u00c2\u00b5g\/mL to 235 \u00c2\u00b5g\/mL and 41 \u00c2\u00b5g\/mL to 85 \u00c2\u00b5g\/mL, respectively.[L30448] T<sub>max<\/sub> is about 3 hours.[A227963]","toxicity":"The intravenous LD<sub>50<\/sub> is > 300 mg\/kg in mice and > 200 mg\/kg in rats.[L31408] There is limited information on the overdose from cetuximab.\n\nIn clinical trials, cetuximab was associated with serious and fatal infusion reactions, cardiopulmonary arrest or sudden death, and serious dermatologic toxicities.

It has been used for more than five decades for varying conditions, including variceal bleeding, diabetes insipidus, and, more recently, vasodilatory shock.[A228013] It is currently marketed under the trademark VASOSTRICT\u00c2\u00ae by PAR Pharmaceuticals.[L31413]","aliases":"Pitressin Inj 10 Unit\/0.5ml|Vasopressin Inj 20unit\/ml USP|Pressyn Ar|Pitressin|Vasopressin Injection|Vasopressin Injection USP|Vasopressin|Vasostrict","indication":"Vasopressin is indicated to increase blood pressure in adults in vasodilatory shock refractory to the application of fluids and catecholamines.[L31413]","pharmacodynamics":"Vasopressin is a nonapeptide antidiuretic hormone involved in modulating various physiological processes, including autonomic signalling, stress response, behaviour, and memory; the most well-known modulation is of blood pressure.[A110, A111, A112, A113, L31413] Vasopressin acts both within the brain and in the periphery to modulate blood pressure through sympathetic outflow, baroreflex modulation, vasoconstriction, and renal fluid retention.[A228008, A228013, A228018] These mechanisms vary by location and physiological state, leading to occasionally contradictory responses to vasopressin. Although generally safe, vasopressin may worsen cardiac output in patients with impaired cardiac function. The cessation of vasopressin therapy may result in transient reversible diabetes insipidus, which may require additional desmopressin or vasopressin to manage.[L31413]","moa":"Vasopressin, Cyclo (1-6) L-Cysteinyl-L-Tyrosyl-L-PhenylalanylL-Glutaminyl-L-Asparaginyl-L-Cysteinyl-L-Prolyl-L-Arginyl-L-Glycinamide, is a cyclic nonapeptide hormone primarily produced by the supraoptic and periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus.[A228008, L31413] Vasopressin release is mediated by sensory pathways, in which either a 2% increase in plasma osmolarity or a 10% decrease in blood pressure causes the release of endogenous vasopressin.[A228013] Upon release, vasopressin mediates a variety of physiological effects, both centrally and systemically, primarily by binding to G-protein-coupled receptors termed V<sub>1<\/sub> (V<sub>1A<\/sub>), V<sub>2<\/sub>, and V<sub>3<\/sub> (V<sub>1B<\/sub>).\n\nV<sub>1<\/sub> receptors are abundantly expressed in the brain whereby vasopressin binding can increase blood pressure through autonomic pathways.[A228008] Peripherally, V<sub>1<\/sub> is localized in the blood vessels (vascular smooth muscle), platelets, adrenal glands, kidneys, and liver.[A228008, A228018] Vasopressin binding to V<sub>1<\/sub> causes hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate into inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3<\/sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG) by phospholipase C, which in turn release intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C (PKC) to open voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) while closing potassium channels. Overall, intracellular calcium levels rise, which bind calmodulin and cause muscular contraction, resulting in vasoconstriction.[A228013] This is balanced by the apparent ability of vasopressin to induce vasodilation through binding oxytocin receptors and activating endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase; NO acts antagonistically to reduce muscle contraction.[A228013] It is also thought that vasopressin, acting through both V<sub>1<\/sub> and oxytocin receptors, causes the cardiac release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which has a negative inotropic effect; indeed, vasopressin tends to decrease heart rate and cardiac output, although the opposite effect has been noted with low doses.[A228013, L31413]\n\nV<sub>2<\/sub> receptors are abundantly expressed in the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts of the kidneys.[A228018, A228023] Vasopressin binding to V<sub>2<\/sub> causes activation of a G<sub>s<\/sub> protein that subsequently activates protein kinase A (PKA) through adenylyl cyclase-mediated increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which leads to phosphorylation of the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and its trafficking to the cell surface.[A228018, A228023] Increased AQP2 levels lead to increased water reabsorption and explains vasopressin's antidiuretic effects.[A228018]\n\nV<sub>3<\/sub> (formerly V<sub>1B<\/sub>) receptors are primarily located in the anterior pituitary and brain.[A228008, A228018] Vasopressin released during acute stress causes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release from the pituitary through V<sub>3<\/sub> and by potentiating the effects of corticotrophin-releasing factor. Within the brain itself, V<sub>3<\/sub> activation modulates various effects, including recognition, memory, aggression, anxiety, and depression.[A228008]\n\nThus, vasopressin can affect a wide variety of physiological processes, often in apparently contradictory ways depending on the patient's dose and physiological state. Vasodilatory shock causes an immediate release of vasopressin from 20 to 200 times its normal serum concentration, which falls again to normal levels in prolonged shock; in this context, normal serum levels are insufficient to control the pathologic vasodilation.[A228013, A228018] In these cases, vasopressin acts to depolarize hyperpolarized vascular smooth muscle cells, restore sensitivity to catecholamines, and inhibit excessive nitric oxide production, primarily through acting through V<sub>1<\/sub> receptors.

{"drug_bankID":"DB00007","name":"Leuprolide","description":"Leuprolide is a synthetic 9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]\n\nLeuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.","aliases":"Eligard|Viadur|Camcevi|Lupron Depot Ped|Lupron Depot|Fensolvi|Lupaneta Pack|Leuprolide Acetate Injection|Leuprolide|\n      |Zeulide Depot|Lupron|Leuprolide Acetate|Lupron Depot-PED","indication":"Leuprolide is indicated for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer[L13781, L13790] as well as for the treatment of pediatric patients with central precocious puberty (CPP).[L13784, L13787] Leuprolide mesylate, as an injectable emulsion, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer.[L34415] In combination with oral [norethisterone] (also known as norethindrone), leuprolide is also indicated for the initial treatment of the symptoms of endometriosis.[L10310] Finally, in combination with iron supplementation, leuprolide is indicated for the preoperative hematological improvement of anemic patients with uterine leiomyomata (uterine fibroids).[L13814]","pharmacodynamics":"Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue that functions as a GnRH receptor superagonist.[A203132, A203222] After an initial spike in GnRH-mediated steroidal production, including testosterone and estradiol, prolonged use results in a significant drop in circulating steroid levels, in line with those produced through other forms of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).[A203126, A203129, A203132] The corresponding hormonal\/steroidal changes produce specific adverse effects in different patient populations.\n\nIn women undergoing treatment for endometriosis or uterine leiomyomata, careful consideration regarding pregnancy status is advised. The initial increase in estradiol levels may worsen symptoms such as pain and bleeding. Long-term use of leuprolide is associated with loss of bone mineral density. Patients co-administered with [norethisterone] may experience sudden vision loss, proptosis, diplopia, migraine, thrombophlebitis, and pulmonary embolism and may also be at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Patients with a history of depression may experience severe recurrence of depressive symptoms.[L10310, L13814]\n\nIn men undergoing palliative treatment for advanced\/metastatic prostate cancer, short-term spikes in testosterone levels may cause tumour flare and associated symptoms such as bone pain, hematuria, neuropathy, bladder and\/or ureteral obstruction, and spinal cord compression. In addition, patients are at increased risk of developing hyperglycemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, which may manifest through myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac death, or prolonged QT\/QTc interval. In addition, Leuprolide may cause convulsions and embryo-fetal toxicity.[L13781, L13790]\n\nIn pediatric patients undergoing treatment for central precocious puberty (CPP), the initial steroidal spike may be associated with increased clinical signs of puberty within 2-4 weeks of treatment initiation. In addition, leuprolide may cause convulsions and psychiatric symptoms, including irritability, impatience, aggression, anger, and crying.[L13784, L13787]","moa":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a naturally occurring decapeptide that modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. GnRH binds to corresponding receptors (GnRHRs) on the anterior pituitary gonadotropes, which in turn release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); these, in turn, affect the downstream synthesis and release of the sex hormones testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrone, and estradiol.[A203126, A203132]\n\nDespite the variety of conditions indicated for treatment with leuprolide, the mechanism of action underlying efficacy is the same in all cases. As a GnRHR agonist, leuprolide binds to and initially activates downstream LH and FSH release; this initial spike in gonadotropin levels is responsible for some of the adverse effects associated with treatment. After 2-4 weeks of treatment, continuous stimulation of GnRHR results in feedback inhibition and significant downregulation of LH, FSH, and their corresponding downstream effects, producing a therapeutic benefit. These effects are reversible upon treatment discontinuation.[A203126, A203129, A203132, A203222, L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814]","absorption":"Leuprolide is typically administered as a single-dose long-acting formulation employing either microsphere or biodegradable solid depot technologies.[A203126] Regardless of the exact formulation and initial dose strength, the C<sub>max<\/sub> is typically achieved by 4-5 hours post-injection and displays large variability in the range of 4.6 - 212 ng\/mL.
